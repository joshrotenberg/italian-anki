# TOML Migration Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Converted all JSON files to TOML format**
   - Used `json_to_toml.py` to convert all existing JSON files to TOML format
   - Maintained the original JSON files for backward compatibility

2. **Validated all converted TOML files**
   - Used `validate.py` to ensure all TOML files follow the project's schema requirements
   - All 103 deck files (both JSON and TOML) passed validation

3. **Tested generating Anki decks with TOML files**
   - Successfully generated decks in per-file mode
   - Successfully generated decks in per-level mode
   - Successfully generated decks in uber mode

4. **Updated tools to support TOML format**
   - Updated `fix_tags.py` to support both JSON and TOML formats
   - Verified that the CI workflow properly handles TOML files

5. **Verified all tests pass with TOML files**
   - All 11 tests passed successfully

## Current Status

The project now exclusively uses TOML format for deck files. All JSON files have been converted to TOML format and removed from the repository. All tools have been updated to work only with TOML files. The TOML format provides a more readable and maintainable structure for deck definitions, and supports Markdown formatting in card content.

## Future Improvements

1. **Add more TOML-specific features**
   - Explore additional TOML features that could improve deck definitions
   - Consider adding support for more complex TOML structures

2. **Enhance Markdown support**
   - Add support for more Markdown features (tables, code blocks, etc.)
   - Provide more examples of Markdown usage in deck files

3. **Update tests for TOML-specific functionality**
   - Add more tests specifically for TOML format
   - Ensure edge cases are properly handled

4. **Create migration tools for users**
   - Provide tools to help users migrate their own custom decks from JSON to TOML
   - Create documentation explaining the benefits of TOML over JSON

## Conclusion

The migration to TOML format has been successfully completed. The project now exclusively uses TOML for deck definitions, providing a more readable and maintainable format. The addition of Markdown support enhances the capabilities of the project, allowing for more richly formatted card content.
