## How Versioning Works

The Italian Anki Decks project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for version numbers:

- **Major version** (X.0.0): Incremented for incompatible API changes
- **Minor version** (0.X.0): Incremented for new functionality in a backward-compatible manner
- **Patch version** (0.0.X): Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes

The project uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to automate versioning:

- `feat:` commits trigger a minor version bump
- `fix:` commits trigger a patch version bump
- Commits with `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer trigger a major version bump

## Release Process

The project uses [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) for automated version management and release creation, combined with [git-cliff](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff) for structured changelog generation.

When commits are pushed to the `main` branch, release-please automatically:
1. Determines the next version based on commit types
2. Creates or updates a release PR with:
   - Updated `VERSION` file
   - Updated `CHANGELOG.md` (generated by git-cliff)

When a release PR is merged:
1. A new GitHub Release is automatically created
2. The release workflow builds each top-level deck (a1, a2, basic) separately using per-level mode
3. Each deck is uploaded as a separate artifact to the release
