# Italian Grammar Basics

This guide covers the fundamental grammar concepts you need to start building sentences in Italian. These basics form the foundation for more advanced grammar topics.

## Alphabet and Pronunciation

The Italian alphabet has 21 letters (the letters J, K, W, X, and Y are only used in foreign words). Italian pronunciation is relatively straightforward as words are generally pronounced as they are written.

### Key pronunciation rules:

- **C** and **G** are hard (like "cat" and "go") before a, o, u, and soft (like "church" and "gem") before e, i
- **CH** is always hard (like "k")
- **GLI** is pronounced like the "lli" in "million"
- **GN** is pronounced like the "ny" in "canyon"
- **R** is rolled
- **SC** is pronounced like "sh" before e, i

## Basic Sentence Structure

Italian follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, similar to English:

```
Io mangio la pizza. (I eat the pizza.)
```

However, Italian is more flexible with word order than English, and the subject pronoun is often omitted because the verb ending indicates who is performing the action:

```
Mangio la pizza. (I eat the pizza.)
```

## Gender and Number

All Italian nouns have a gender (masculine or feminine) and a number (singular or plural). This is a fundamental concept that affects articles, adjectives, and some verb forms.

### Noun Endings

- Most nouns ending in **-o** are masculine: libro (book)
- Most nouns ending in **-a** are feminine: casa (house)
- Nouns ending in **-e** can be either masculine or feminine: il mare (the sea, masculine), la notte (the night, feminine)

### Plural Formation

- Masculine nouns: **-o** → **-i**: libro → libri
- Feminine nouns: **-a** → **-e**: casa → case
- Nouns ending in **-e** → **-i**: il mare → i mari, la notte → le notti

## Articles

Italian has definite articles (the) and indefinite articles (a/an), which must agree with the gender and number of the noun they modify.

### Definite Articles (The)

| | Singular | Plural |
|---|---|---|
| **Masculine** | il (before consonants)<br>lo (before z, s+consonant, gn, ps, x, y)<br>l' (before vowels) | i (before consonants)<br>gli (before z, s+consonant, gn, ps, x, y, vowels) |
| **Feminine** | la (before consonants)<br>l' (before vowels) | le |

### Indefinite Articles (A/An)

| | Singular |
|---|---|
| **Masculine** | un (before consonants and vowels)<br>uno (before z, s+consonant, gn, ps, x, y) |
| **Feminine** | una (before consonants)<br>un' (before vowels) |

## Subject Pronouns

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|---|---|---|
| 1st | io (I) | noi (we) |
| 2nd | tu (you, informal) | voi (you all) |
| 3rd | lui (he), lei (she), Lei (you, formal) | loro (they) |

## Basic Verb Conjugation

Italian verbs change their endings based on who is performing the action. The three main verb groups are:

1. **-are** verbs (parlare - to speak)
2. **-ere** verbs (credere - to believe)
3. **-ire** verbs (dormire - to sleep)

### Present Tense Example: Parlare (to speak)

| Person | Conjugation |
|---|---|
| io | parlo |
| tu | parli |
| lui/lei/Lei | parla |
| noi | parliamo |
| voi | parlate |
| loro | parlano |

## Forming Questions

In Italian, questions are often formed by simply changing the intonation of a statement:

- Statement: Tu parli italiano. (You speak Italian.)
- Question: Tu parli italiano? (Do you speak Italian?)

Questions can also be formed using question words:

- Chi? (Who?)
- Che cosa? / Cosa? (What?)
- Quando? (When?)
- Dove? (Where?)
- Perché? (Why?)
- Come? (How?)
- Quanto/a/i/e? (How much/many?)

## Negation

To make a sentence negative in Italian, place "non" before the verb:

- Positive: Io parlo italiano. (I speak Italian.)
- Negative: Io non parlo italiano. (I don't speak Italian.)

## Common Expressions

Learning these basic expressions will help you start communicating in Italian:

- Ciao! (Hello/Goodbye, informal)
- Buongiorno! (Good morning/Good day)
- Buonasera! (Good evening)
- Arrivederci! (Goodbye, formal)
- Per favore / Per piacere (Please)
- Grazie (Thank you)
- Prego (You're welcome)
- Sì (Yes)
- No (No)
- Mi chiamo... (My name is...)
- Come stai? (How are you? informal)
- Come sta? (How are you? formal)
- Sto bene, grazie. (I'm fine, thank you.)
