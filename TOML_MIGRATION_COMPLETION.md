# TOML Migration Completion

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to complete the migration from JSON to TOML format in the Italian Anki Decks project. The migration was done in two phases:

1. First phase: Add TOML support while maintaining backward compatibility with JSON
2. Second phase: Remove JSON support and use TOML exclusively

## Changes Made

### 1. Code Changes

#### 1.1 Updated `generate.py`
- Removed JSON import and JSON-specific code
- Modified `load_deck_file` to only support TOML files
- Updated `get_deck_files` to only search for TOML files
- Updated docstrings and comments to reflect TOML-only support

#### 1.2 Updated `validate.py`
- Removed JSON import and JSON-specific code
- Removed `validate_card` function which was only used for JSON files
- Modified `validate_file` to only support TOML files
- Updated `find_deck_files` to only search for TOML files
- Updated docstrings and help text to reflect TOML-only support

#### 1.3 Updated `fix_tags.py`
- Removed JSON import and JSON-specific code
- Modified `fix_tags_in_file` to only support TOML files
- Updated `find_deck_files` to only search for TOML files
- Updated docstrings and help text to reflect TOML-only support

#### 1.4 Updated Tests
- Removed JSON import from `tests/test_generate.py`
- Modified `create_deck_file` to only support TOML format
- Removed `test_per_file_mode_with_format` which tested both JSON and TOML formats
- Updated docstrings and comments to reflect TOML-only support

### 2. Documentation Changes

#### 2.1 Updated `README.md`
- Updated repository description to mention only TOML files
- Updated repository structure section to reflect TOML-only support
- Removed section on converting JSON to TOML
- Updated section on adding new decks to only mention TOML format
- Updated Markdown support section to mention only TOML format

### 3. Data Changes

#### 3.1 Removed JSON Files
- Verified that all JSON files had corresponding TOML files
- Removed all JSON files from the decks directory

## Verification

All tests were run to verify that the project works correctly with TOML files only:

```
$ python -m pytest
============================= test session starts ==============================
collected 7 items
tests/test_generate.py .......                                           [100%]
============================== 7 passed in 0.61s ===============================
```

## Conclusion

The migration from JSON to TOML format has been successfully completed. The project now exclusively uses TOML for deck definitions, which provides a more readable and maintainable format. The removal of JSON support simplifies the codebase and reduces maintenance overhead.
